## 📚 Learning Highlights

### This project helped me practice:

- WebSocket protocol basics (message types, broadcasting).
- Managing state & refs in React with `useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`.
- Structuring full-stack TypeScript projects.
- Building real-time features with graceful handling of connect/disconnect events.
